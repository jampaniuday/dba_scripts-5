    <p>

    <blockquote>
    This brief introduction to JNDI will explore naming and directory concepts 
    in detail and discusses how Java programs can use name and directory 
    services.
    <p>
    The concept of a <i>naming service</i> is the means by which names are 
    associated with objects and objects are found based on their names. The 
    chief function of a naming service is to map people-friendly names to 
    objects, such as addresses, identifiers, or objects typically required and 
    used by computer programs. For example:
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li> Domain Name Systems (DNS) maps machine names (such as
             java.sun.com) to IP addresses (such as 192.18.97.71)
        <li> File systems map a filename (for example
             /u10/app/oracle/9.2.0/dbs/initCUSTDB.ora) to a file handle that a 
             program can use to access the contents of the file.
    </ul>
    <p>
    A variety of naming are extended with a <i>directory services</i>. A 
    directory service associates names with objects and also allows such
    objects to have attributes. It is possible to not only look up an object by 
    its name but also get the object's attributes or even search for the object 
    based on its attributes. Take for example a telephone company's directory 
    service. It is used to map a subscriber's name to his address and telephone 
    number. A computer's directory service is very much like a telephone 
    company's directory service in that both can be used to store information 
    such as a telephone number or address. The computer's directory service is 
    much more powerful because it is available online and can be used to store 
    a variety of information that can be utilized by users, programs, and even 
    the computer itself and other computers.

    <blockquote>
    The JNDI architecture consists of an API and a service provider interface 
    (SPI). All Java applications that utilize naming and directory services use 
    the JNDI API to access a variety of naming and directory services. The SPI 
    on the other hand enables a variety of naming and directory services to be 
    plugged in transparently, thereby allowing the Java application using the 
    JNDI API to access their services.
    <p>
    The JNDI API is included in the Java 2 SDK, v1.3 and higher. For those using
    JDK v1.1 and Java 2 SDK, v1.2, the JNDI API is available as a Java
    Standard Extension.
    <p>
    In order to take advantage of the JNDI, you not only need the JNDI classes
    but also one or more service providers. The Java 2 SDK, v1.3 includes
    three service providers for the following naming/directory services:
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li> Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
        <li> Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) Common
             Object Services (COS)
        <li> Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) Registry
    </ul>
    <p>
    Many other service providers are available for download from the
    JNDI web site
    (<a class="noLinkRed"
        target="_blank"
        href="http://java.sun.com/products/jndi">http://java.sun.com/products/jndi</a>)
    or obtained from other vendors. Remember that if you are using the
    Java Standard Extensions with JDK v1.1 and Java 2 SDK, v1.2, you must first
    download the JNDI classes and one or more service providers.
    <p>
    The one service provider I like to use for testing and will never figure
    out why Sun does not yet include it in the standard SDK is
    <i>file system</i> service provider (<b><code>fscontext.jar</code></b>).
    It can be downloaded from:

    <p>

    <blockquote>
    In the JNDI, all naming and directory operations are performed relative to
    a context. There are no absolute roots and this is where why the JNDI
    defines an <i>initial context</i>, <code>InitialContext</code>, which 
    provides a starting point for naming and directory operations. Once you
    have an initial context, you can use it to look up other contexts and
    objects.
