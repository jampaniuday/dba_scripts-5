  <h1>Introduction</b></h1>

  <p>
    The Java API was designed and built on the OO model. Having a good
    understanding of <i>Design Patterns</i> such as Factory, Bridge and
    Delegate, though not required to be a Java programmer, will help you
    to better understand the use of the API and provide better ways to construct
    objects more flexibly. Design Patterns are certainly one of the most 
    successful software engineering concepts of the past few years. They act as
    tried and true, transferable solutions for specific problem situations and 
    help developers to reach a finished application faster.

  <h1>Use the Java APIs</h1>
  <p>
    What is sometimes hard to teach new comers is that much of the work you 
    need to do has already been done within the APIs. Learning the APIs well
    is one great method to avoiding that "reinventing the wheel" syndrome. In 
    most cases, not only is the code already available, but more efficient 
    than the reinvented one. A great example is the Collections API in
    <code>java.util</code>. Given the high degree of generality and 
    regularity, there is very little reason to invent your own data
    structuring code.

  <!--
   | **********************************************************
   |   Use Javadoc
   | **********************************************************
   +-->
  <h1>Use Javadoc</h1>
  <p>
    When learning the Java API, one of the greatest resources is the Java 2
    online documentation through a web browser. For the location of
    all online Java API Documentation, visit
    <a class="noLink" 
       target="_blank"
       href="http://java.sun.com/api/index.html">http://java.sun.com/api/index.html</a>
    Now the question is, where did all of this documentation come from? Did
    Sun hire someone to manual create the HTML for these docs? The answer is no.
    The documentation exists because the developers of the API took the time
    to write Javadoc comments when writing the code.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a full review of writing Javadoc, visit the section labeled
    <b><font color="#693019">Javadoc</font></b> within this Java Programming
    corner.
  </p>
  <p>
    Simply put, use Javadoc. Java provides one of the best mechanisms for API
    documentation. Also, always document as you write the code. How often do
    you come back to the code at a later time to document.
  </p>

  <h1>Use Design Patterns</h1>
  <p>
    As mentioned earlier in this document, I discussed the use of 
    <i>Design Patterns</i>. Many books on object-oriented programming promote
    the use of Design Patterns as they provide a powerful catalog of code that
    programmers so often reinvent.
