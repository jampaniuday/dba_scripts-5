GENERATING RANDOM CHARACTERS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Since Math.random() generates a value between 0 and 1, you need only
multiply it by the upper bound of the range of numbers you want to product
(26 for the letters in the alphabet) and add an offset to establish
the lower bound.

Although it appears you're switching on a character here, the switch statement
is actually using the integral value of the character. The singly-quoted characters
in the case statements also produce integral values that are used to comparison.

Math.random() produces a double, so the value 26 is converted to a double to perform
the multiplication, which also produces a double. This means that 'a' must be
converted to a double to perform the addition. The double result is turned back
into a "char" with the cast.

If for example, you have the value 29.7 and you cast it to a char, the resulting
value is 29. Always remember, that casting from a float or double to an integral
value always truncates.
