    <blockquote>
    One of Java's strengths is that it was designed with the assumption that the
    environment in which it was running would be changing dynamically. Classes 
    are loaded dynamically, binding is done dynamically, and object instances 
    are created dynamically on the fly when they are needed. What has not been 
    very dynamic historically is the ability to manipulate "anonymous" classes. 
    In this context, an anonymous class is one that is loaded or presented to a 
    Java class at run time and whose type was previously unknown to the Java 
    program. [Sun 1998]
    <p>
    Java programs can now "reflect" upon themselves or upon an arbitrary class 
    to determine the methods and fields defined by that class, arguments and so 
    on. What exactly does that mean? By utilizing the packages in the Java 
    Reflection API to obtain complete information about any object, array, 
    method, constructor, or field.
    <p>
    Fundamentally, the Reflection API consists of two components: objects that 
    represent the various parts of a class file, and a means for extracting 
    those objects in a safe and secure way. The latter is very important, as 
    Java provides many security safeguards, and it would not make sense to 
    provide a set of classes that invalidated those safeguards.
    <p>    
    The classes that support the Java reflection API can be found in the 
    <code>java.lang.reflect</code> package. Reflection is the ability for a
    class or object to examine itself. With reflection, you can use Java code
    to look at an object (actually, the class of an object) to determine
    its structre. Depending on the limits imposed by the 
    <i>security manager</i>, it is possible  to find information about
    constructors, methods, and fields a class has, as well as their
    attributes. It is even possible to change the value of fields, 
    dynamically invoke methods, and construct new objects. This is just as you
    would with primitive pointers to variables and methods. This can all be
    done on objects that your Java code has never seen before.
    <p>
    Reflection is used a lot by JavaBeans to determine the capabilities of
    objects during runtime. Reflection is also used by object serialization
    to tear apart and build objects for transport over streams or into 
    persistent storage. The internals  of reflection are guarded by the 
    security manager. You Java code is not allowed to perform anything with
    the reflection API that it couldn't do with static (ordinary, compiled)
    code. An object cannot use the reflection APIs to find out about data
    fields that it wouldn't normally be able to access (i.e. another objects
    private fields), and you cannot use it to modify data inappropriately.
    <p>
    The three key features of a class are:
    <ul>
        <li> Fields (variables)
        <li> Methods
        <li> Constructors
    </ul>
    <p>
    The three methods that provide access to the above features are:
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li> <code>java.lang.reflect.Field</code>
        <li> <code>java.lang.reflect.Method</code>
        <li> <code>java.lang.reflect.Constructor</code>
    </ul>
    <p>
    All of the above objects can be created using the <code><b>Class</b></code>
    object.
    <p>
    The <code>Class</code> class provides two pairs of methods for getting
    at each type of feature. One pair allows access to a class's public 
    features (even those inherited from its superclass), while the other pair
    allows for access to any public or nonpublic item declared within the
    class (but not features that are inherited). Keep in mind that all 
    security considerations are applied.
