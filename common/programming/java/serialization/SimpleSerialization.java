/**
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This program demonstrates how to write an application that saves the data
 * content of an arbitrary object by use of Java Object Serialization. In its
 * simplest form, object serialization is an automatic way to save and load
 * the state of an object. Basically, an object of any class that implements
 * the Serialization interface can be saved and restored from a stream. Special
 * stream subclasses, "ObjectInputStream" and "ObjectOutputStream", are used to
 * serialize primitive types and objects. Subclasses of Serializable classes are
 * also serializable. The default serialization mechanism saves the value of an
 * object's nonstatic and nontransient member variables.
 * 
 * One of the most important (and tricky) aspects about serialization is that
 * when an object is serialized, any object references it contains are also
 * serialized. Serialization can capture entire "graphs" of interconnected
 * objects and put them back together on the receiving end. The implication is
 * that any object we serialize must contain only references to other 
 * Serializable objects. We can take control of marking nonserializable
 * members as transient or overriding the default serialization mechanisms. The
 * transient modifier can be applied to any instance variable to indicate that
 * its contents are not useful outside of the current context and should never
 * be saved.
 * 
 * In the following example, we create a Hashtable and write it to a disk file
 * called HTExample.ser. The Hashtable object is serializable because it 
 * implements the Serializable interface.
 * 
 * The doLoad method, reads the Hashtable from the HTExample.ser file, using 
 * the readObject() method of ObjectInputStream. The ObjectInputStream class
 * is a lot like DataInputStream, except that it includes the readObject()
 * method. The return type of readObject() is Object, so we will need to cast
 * it to a Hashtable.
