Constructing thread  (1)...


Constructing thread  (2)...

  - Thread 1  ( Current Countdown = 5 )
  - Thread 2  ( Current Countdown = 5 )

Both threads have been started....

Now lets get a list of all threads within the program...

  - Thread List [0] = main
  - Thread List [1] = Thread 1
  - Thread List [2] = Thread 2

Will now wait until both threads are completed...

  - Thread 2  ( Current Countdown = 4 )
  - Thread 2  ( Current Countdown = 3 )
  - Thread 2  ( Current Countdown = 2 )
  - Thread 1  ( Current Countdown = 4 )
  - Thread 2  ( Current Countdown = 1 )

Ending thread 2...

  - Thread 1  ( Current Countdown = 3 )
  - Thread 1  ( Current Countdown = 2 )
  - Thread 1  ( Current Countdown = 1 )

Ending thread 1...

All working threads are complete...
