Solution:
The Fast Recovery Area (FRA) is full with old archive log files so we need to clean this up by removing old archive logs.
If you have production environment, back these up to tape or storage for recovery and archival purposes.

Login to RMAN and run the following commands:

RMAN> CONNECT target /

connected TO target DATABASE: INSTANT (DBID=1234567890)

RMAN> crosscheck archivelog ALL;

Note: You can schedule this command once a week.
The crosscheck command does NOT DELETE the information about the logs that it
could NOT find ON disk, it just updates their STATUS IN the repository AS 'EXPIRED'.
TO obtain a list OF logs marked AS 'EXPIRED' USE the following command:

RMAN> list expired archivelog ALL;

IF it IS NOT necessary TO keep the information about these
logs IN the repository, DELETE them WITH command:

RMAN> DELETE expired archivelog ALL;


RMAN> delete archivelog all completed before 'SYSDATE-1';

The above RMAN command will delete old archive logs past 24 hours.

Now you should be able to connect to the database.


Below are some useful queries to check on FRA available space:

SQL> SELECT name, free_mb, total_mb, free_mb/total_mb*100 "%" FROM v$asm_diskgroup;

NAME FREE_MB TOTAL_MB %
------------------------------ ---------- ---------- ----------
DATA 823641 1044450 78.8588252
FRA 207743 511992 40.5754387
LOG 306958 307191 99.9241514


SQL>

set lines 100
col name format a60
select name
, floor(space_limit / 1024 / 1024) "Size MB"
, ceil(space_used / 1024 / 1024) "Used MB"
from v$recovery_file_dest
order by name
/


NAME Size MB Used MB
------------------------------------------------------------ ---------- ----------
+FRA 102400 302965


If you want to change the default size for the FRA you can issue the following command from SQL*PLUS:

SQL> alter system set db_recovery_file_dest_size=600G;

System altered.

Then you should archive logs:
SQL> archive log all;
3 logs archived.
